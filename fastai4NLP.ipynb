              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "xxbos xxmaj well , the movie is basically about the last days of a specific xxmaj russian regiment stationed in xxmaj xxunk , before the main troop withdrawal in 1985 . xxmaj the movie accurately portrays the grim realities of xxmaj russian army that have made it infamous : \" xxunk \" ( officers and xxunk physically harassing , beating and humiliating younger recruits ) , mixed character of war ( you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next ) , life of women at the front lines , documentary footages of helicopter assaults , and coffins being xxunk and sent home in heave xxup xxunk xxmaj hercules class xxmaj russian cargo planes with xxunk to jam xxmaj stinger missiles , fatigue , boredom , anti - war sentiment , emotional side simply put . xxmaj the there 's some action scenes , but they are poorly done , and often are illogical , like xxmaj major xxmaj bandura 's suicidal walk and turning of his back to 10-year - old kid armed with xxup ak-47 who 's father he just killed . xxmaj also the fact that in the middle of firefight in the mountains heavy grenade launcher pops out of nowhere ( and any half - bright person knows that it 's virtually impossible to hump 40 - 50 xxunk launcher on the march anyone ) . xxmaj but at the same time films shows that war is a dirty affair , where murder is sometimes xxunk , wanton destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal , indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage inevitable during war ... xxmaj some food for thought as to why xxmaj afghan war as lost .. xxmaj not the best war movie made , but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching .,xxbos ' xxmaj dead xxmaj letter xxmaj office ' is a low - budget film about a couple of employees of the xxmaj australian postal service , struggling to rebuild their damaged lives . xxmaj unfortunately , the acting is poor and the links between the characters ' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over - xxunk represented . xxmaj what 's most disappointing of all , however , is the portrayal is life in the office of the film 's title : there 's no mechanisation whatsoever , and it 's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living . xxmaj granted , part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure , but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s , if it ever truly existed . xxmaj it 's a shame , as the film 's overall tone is poignant and wry , and there 's some promise in the scenario : but few of the details convince . xxmaj overall , it feels the work of someone who has n't actually experienced much of real life ; a student film , with a concept and an outline , but sadly little else .,xxbos xxmaj this movie is absurd . xxmaj absolutely terrible . xxmaj michael xxmaj keaton and xxmaj andy xxmaj garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie . xxmaj the plot is totally not believable ! xxmaj michael xxmaj keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective , but then escapes . xxmaj he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital . xxmaj he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital , blowing up the power generators and a xxunk bridge ( why ? ) . xxmaj and to top that xxmaj andy xxmaj garcia ( father of the dying boy ) and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow . xxmaj the plot is such baloney ! xxmaj maybe the worse movie i have ever see .,xxbos xxmaj if i had never seen an episode of the original xxmaj avengers , with xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj rigg , or xxmaj xxunk , i would have appreciated this series more . xxmaj while the cast did its best to sustain the action and interest of the scripts , i was just caught up in comparing the episodes to the original series . xxmaj there was an expectation of xxmaj steed participating more in fight scenes , and the continuity seemed as though the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors . xxmaj to be honest , i ca n't blame them for trying to resurrect the fans from the original series , but it just did n't work , as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season . xxmaj watching xxmaj steed labor through this series reminded me of xxmaj gen. xxmaj macarthur when he said , ' xxmaj old soldiers never die , they just fade away ! ',xxbos xxmaj as an avid xxmaj gone xxmaj with the xxmaj wind fan , i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . xxmaj luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . xxmaj when the book xxmaj scarlett came out , i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . xxmaj while the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as i was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . xxmaj however , i consider the six hours i spent watching the \" xxmaj scarlett \" miniseries to be some of the worst - spent hours of my life . xxmaj discrediting any of the original character traits so well - formed in xxmaj margaret xxmaj mitchell 's book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book xxmaj scarlett stayed away from . xxmaj the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well - formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . xxmaj in the novel , xxmaj scarlett o'hara xxmaj butler follows her estranged husband xxmaj rhett xxmaj butler to xxmaj charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . xxmaj after coming to an \" arrangement \" with xxmaj rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in xxmaj savannah . xxmaj eventually , she accompanies her cousin xxmaj colum , a passionate leader of the xxmaj fenian xxmaj brotherhood , to xxmaj ireland , to further explore her family 's \" roots that go deep , \" and is eventually named \" xxmaj the o'hara , \" the head of the family . xxmaj while her duties as xxmaj the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of xxmaj ballyhara , xxmaj scarlett ventures out into the world of the xxmaj english landowners , and instantly becomes a sought - after guest at many of their parties . xxmaj she , having been scorned by xxmaj rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry xxmaj luke , the earl of xxmaj fenton , until xxmaj rhett comes along in a clichéd \" night - on - white - horse \" - type of a rescue . xxmaj the \" xxmaj scarlett \" miniseries fails even to do this justice . xxmaj raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family , the series shows xxmaj scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . \n",

              "xxbos xxmaj well , the movie is basically about the last days of a specific xxmaj russian regiment stationed in xxmaj xxunk , before the main troop withdrawal in 1985 . xxmaj the movie accurately portrays the grim realities of xxmaj russian army that have made it infamous : \" xxunk \" ( officers and xxunk physically harassing , beating and humiliating younger recruits ) , mixed character of war ( you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next ) , life of women at the front lines , documentary footages of helicopter assaults , and coffins being xxunk and sent home in heave xxup xxunk xxmaj hercules class xxmaj russian cargo planes with xxunk to jam xxmaj stinger missiles , fatigue , boredom , anti - war sentiment , emotional side simply put . xxmaj the there 's some action scenes , but they are poorly done , and often are illogical , like xxmaj major xxmaj bandura 's suicidal walk and turning of his back to 10-year - old kid armed with xxup ak-47 who 's father he just killed . xxmaj also the fact that in the middle of firefight in the mountains heavy grenade launcher pops out of nowhere ( and any half - bright person knows that it 's virtually impossible to hump 40 - 50 xxunk launcher on the march anyone ) . xxmaj but at the same time films shows that war is a dirty affair , where murder is sometimes xxunk , wanton destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal , indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage inevitable during war ... xxmaj some food for thought as to why xxmaj afghan war as lost .. xxmaj not the best war movie made , but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching .,xxbos ' xxmaj dead xxmaj letter xxmaj office ' is a low - budget film about a couple of employees of the xxmaj australian postal service , struggling to rebuild their damaged lives . xxmaj unfortunately , the acting is poor and the links between the characters ' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over - xxunk represented . xxmaj what 's most disappointing of all , however , is the portrayal is life in the office of the film 's title : there 's no mechanisation whatsoever , and it 's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living . xxmaj granted , part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure , but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s , if it ever truly existed . xxmaj it 's a shame , as the film 's overall tone is poignant and wry , and there 's some promise in the scenario : but few of the details convince . xxmaj overall , it feels the work of someone who has n't actually experienced much of real life ; a student film , with a concept and an outline , but sadly little else .,xxbos xxmaj this movie is absurd . xxmaj absolutely terrible . xxmaj michael xxmaj keaton and xxmaj andy xxmaj garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie . xxmaj the plot is totally not believable ! xxmaj michael xxmaj keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective , but then escapes . xxmaj he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital . xxmaj he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital , blowing up the power generators and a xxunk bridge ( why ? ) . xxmaj and to top that xxmaj andy xxmaj garcia ( father of the dying boy ) and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow . xxmaj the plot is such baloney ! xxmaj maybe the worse movie i have ever see .,xxbos xxmaj if i had never seen an episode of the original xxmaj avengers , with xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj rigg , or xxmaj xxunk , i would have appreciated this series more . xxmaj while the cast did its best to sustain the action and interest of the scripts , i was just caught up in comparing the episodes to the original series . xxmaj there was an expectation of xxmaj steed participating more in fight scenes , and the continuity seemed as though the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors . xxmaj to be honest , i ca n't blame them for trying to resurrect the fans from the original series , but it just did n't work , as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season . xxmaj watching xxmaj steed labor through this series reminded me of xxmaj gen. xxmaj macarthur when he said , ' xxmaj old soldiers never die , they just fade away ! ',xxbos xxmaj as an avid xxmaj gone xxmaj with the xxmaj wind fan , i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . xxmaj luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . xxmaj when the book xxmaj scarlett came out , i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . xxmaj while the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as i was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . xxmaj however , i consider the six hours i spent watching the \" xxmaj scarlett \" miniseries to be some of the worst - spent hours of my life . xxmaj discrediting any of the original character traits so well - formed in xxmaj margaret xxmaj mitchell 's book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book xxmaj scarlett stayed away from . xxmaj the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well - formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . xxmaj in the novel , xxmaj scarlett o'hara xxmaj butler follows her estranged husband xxmaj rhett xxmaj butler to xxmaj charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . xxmaj after coming to an \" arrangement \" with xxmaj rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in xxmaj savannah . xxmaj eventually , she accompanies her cousin xxmaj colum , a passionate leader of the xxmaj fenian xxmaj brotherhood , to xxmaj ireland , to further explore her family 's \" roots that go deep , \" and is eventually named \" xxmaj the o'hara , \" the head of the family . xxmaj while her duties as xxmaj the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of xxmaj ballyhara , xxmaj scarlett ventures out into the world of the xxmaj english landowners , and instantly becomes a sought - after guest at many of their parties . xxmaj she , having been scorned by xxmaj rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry xxmaj luke , the earl of xxmaj fenton , until xxmaj rhett comes along in a clichéd \" night - on - white - horse \" - type of a rescue . xxmaj the \" xxmaj scarlett \" miniseries fails even to do this justice . xxmaj raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family , the series shows xxmaj scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . \n",

',xxbos xxmaj as an avid xxmaj gone xxmaj with the xxmaj wind fan , i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . xxmaj luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . xxmaj when the book xxmaj scarlett came out , i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . xxmaj while the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as i was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . xxmaj however , i consider the six hours i spent watching the \" xxmaj scarlett \" miniseries to be some of the worst - spent hours of my life . xxmaj discrediting any of the original character traits so well - formed in xxmaj margaret xxmaj mitchell 's book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book xxmaj scarlett stayed away from . xxmaj the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well - formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . xxmaj in the novel , xxmaj scarlett o'hara xxmaj butler follows her estranged husband xxmaj rhett xxmaj butler to xxmaj charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . xxmaj after coming to an \" arrangement \" with xxmaj rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in xxmaj savannah . xxmaj eventually , she accompanies her cousin xxmaj colum , a passionate leader of the xxmaj fenian xxmaj brotherhood , to xxmaj ireland , to further explore her family 's \" roots that go deep , \" and is eventually named \" xxmaj the o'hara , \" the head of the family . xxmaj while her duties as xxmaj the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of xxmaj ballyhara , xxmaj scarlett ventures out into the world of the xxmaj english landowners , and instantly becomes a sought - after guest at many of their parties . xxmaj she , having been scorned by xxmaj rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry xxmaj luke , the earl of xxmaj fenton , until xxmaj rhett comes along in a clichéd \" night - on - white - horse \" - type of a rescue . xxmaj the \" xxmaj scarlett \" miniseries fails even to do this justice . xxmaj raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family , the series shows xxmaj scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . \n",
